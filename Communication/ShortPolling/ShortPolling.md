### Short Polling

- Short polling is a technique used in web applications to retrieve data from the server at regular intervals. 

- It involves the client making repeated requests to the server to check for updates. 
  
- This method is straightforward but can lead to increased server load and latency, as the client continuously polls the server even when there are no updates.

- Short polling is often implemented using JavaScript's `setInterval` function to send requests at specified intervals.

- The server responds with the current state or data, and the client updates its UI accordingly.

- While short polling is simple to implement, it is not the most efficient method for real-time updates, especially in applications with high traffic or frequent updates.
